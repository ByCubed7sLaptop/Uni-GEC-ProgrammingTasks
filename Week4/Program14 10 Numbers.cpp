    /*
        Write a program

         That asks to user to enter 2 numbers.
            o Using those 2 numbers, calculate the sum (total) of the numbers and calculate the mean (average) value of those numbers.
            o Finally, print out the sum and mean values to the console.
    
         Ask the user to enter another number.
            o Calculate the sum and mean with the current total and output in the same way as in step 1. (This must add to the first numbers.)
    
         Continue to ask the user indefinitely until the user enters a value of zero.

        Things to consider:
             The user being able to enter 0 during the first two numbers and not have the program exit.
             Which numbers might not result in whole numbers?
