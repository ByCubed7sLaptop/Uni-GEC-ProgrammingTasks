    /*
        This program is going to be a little more complex than the previous programs. For this task you will need to create a program that does the following:
        
        •	Stores two ints, rain = 1; and snow = 2.
        
        •	You will need to create two more variable to hold a user’s answers and then ask the following:
            o	Please tell me if it is raining with ‘1’ or snowing with ‘2’. And store the answer.
            o	Then ask what the temperature is in Celsius.
        
        •	Next create an if – else if – else statement
            o	If the users answer is equal to 1, jump into a nested if else statement with the condition of if temp > 15, wear a light raincoat, otherwise wear a thick coat.
            o	If the user selected 2, jump into a nested if – else if – else statement with the conditions of, if temp > 5 tell them to wear something warm. Or if temp > 0 tell them to wrap up well, otherwise tell them to stay home.
            o	The final outer else should just inform them to have a nice day as it is neither raining nor snowing.
        
        •	Test all your conditions to make sure your program works correctly.
