        •	A char to hold/store the user’s status and an int for the user’s game choice.

        •	You will then need to ask:
            o	Please tell me your status with ‘s’ for student, ‘t’ for teacher or ‘o’ for other.
            o	Then ask which game they would like, 1 or 2?

        •	Next create an if – else if – else statement
            o	If the user’s status is equal to s or t and the game value is equal to 1. Output a message that they can get 20% discount.
            o	If the user’s status is s or t and the game value is equal to 2. Output a message saying they can get a 10% discount.
            o	Otherwise inform them they are not entitled to a discount.
