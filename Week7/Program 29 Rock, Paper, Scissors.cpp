/*
	Write a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors; where the user is prompted to enter their choice as a string 
	(e.g. Paper or paper) and the computer's choice is generated randomly. 
	The first to score 3 wins, is the overall winner.

	At the conclusion of the game your program should output the result (who won) and the scores of both players. 
	Those not familiar with the game can learn a little about it here 
	(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors)

	When you have completed your program, take a screen shot of the last three plays and the concluding output (see below for an example).
