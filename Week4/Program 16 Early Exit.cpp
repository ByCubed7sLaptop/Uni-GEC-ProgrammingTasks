		Write a C++ program, which creates an integer called playerLife. Set it to a starting value of 100 and outputs this to the console screen.

		The program should ask the user how much health to decrease the player life by with the following output:
		>> "Question X: How much damage should I deal?"

		It should ask this question 10 times unless the health value goes below 0.

		In the event of the playerLife variable going below zero before the question is asked 10 times, the following should be output:
		>> "Early end. Player Died!"

		Otherwise all questions should succeed to be asked and the following should be output:
		>> "All question asked. Player Survived!"
